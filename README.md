Prioritize is a simple [Sandstorm][1] app to help keep track of
periodic tasks which have some flexibility. Examples: misc. cleaning
tasks, but also things like getting some exercise.

You add tasks with a "period" in days. The app then lists tasks sorted
by how overdue they are, and you can mark them as "done," at which point
they are removed from the list until their period has elapsed again.

This can be better than to-do apps where tasks just have fixed
deadlines; it's great for organizing tasks that sometime slip by a day
or two.
